# SimpleWriter

SimpleWriter is the official Substance starter example. It includes a minimal [setup for realtime collaboration](./server.js). It sets up a minimal environment for Substance editor development. Fork this code and create your own editor.

Read the [tutorial](http://substance.io/docs/beta5/your-first-editor.html).

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/substance/examples.git
```

Unless you want to make contributions to the lastest development version, please checkout the master branch which shows usage of the latest Substance release.

```bash
git checkout master
```

Now install dependencies and start the dev environment.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:5555`.
